Feature: Incremental Gaussian Process Learning for Test Importance
  As a test optimization system
  I want to use incremental Gaussian Process learning with sparse approximations
  So that I can efficiently predict test importance for large test suites

  Background:
    Given a Gaussian Process model for test quality prediction
    And a stream of test execution results
    And memory constraints for large-scale deployment

  @incremental-learning
  Scenario: Incremental model updates without full retraining
    Given a GP model trained on 100 observations
    When I receive 10 new test results
    Then the model should update incrementally
    And update time should be O(m²n) not O(n³)
    And predictions should incorporate new knowledge
    And model quality should improve or maintain

  @sparse-approximation
  Scenario: Efficient sparse GP with inducing points
    Given a dataset with 1000 test observations
    And a limit of 50 inducing points
    When training the sparse GP model
    Then memory usage should be O(m²) not O(n²)
    And prediction time should be O(m²) not O(n²)
    And approximation quality should be within 95% of full GP
    And inducing points should cover the input space well

  @hyperparameter-adaptation
  Scenario: Online hyperparameter optimization
    Given a GP model with initial hyperparameters
    When processing batches of 20 observations
    Then hyperparameters should adapt every 5 batches
    And log marginal likelihood should improve
    And optimization should use gradient-based methods
    And adaptation should be stable without drift

  @uncertainty-quantification
  Scenario: Calibrated uncertainty estimates
    Given a trained sparse GP model
    When making predictions on test combinations
    Then 95% confidence intervals should contain true values 95% of time
    And uncertainty should increase for extrapolation
    And uncertainty should decrease near observations
    And epistemic uncertainty should be separated from noise

  @memory-efficiency
  Scenario: Bounded memory usage with data compression
    Given a memory limit of 100MB
    When processing 10000 observations
    Then memory usage should stay below limit
    And old observations should be compressed or forgotten
    And model quality should degrade gracefully
    And critical observations should be retained

  @active-learning
  Scenario: Uncertainty-based test selection
    Given a partially trained GP model
    When selecting next tests to run
    Then selection should maximize information gain
    And high-uncertainty regions should be explored
    And acquisition function should balance exploration/exploitation
    And batch selection should consider diversity

  @prediction-quality
  Scenario: Accuracy vs speed tradeoffs
    Given different approximation levels [10, 25, 50, 100] inducing points
    When comparing prediction quality and speed
    Then higher m should give better accuracy
    And prediction time should scale as O(m²)
    And quality metrics should be monotonic in m
    And optimal m should be determinable

  @integration
  Scenario: Integration with Guardian's EMT engine
    Given Guardian's evolutionary test framework
    When GP predictions guide test evolution
    Then fitness evaluation should use GP predictions
    And uncertainty should influence mutation rates
    And model should update with evolution results
    And convergence should be faster than random

  @edge-cases
  Scenario: Handling edge cases gracefully
    Given various edge case inputs
    When processing empty test sets
    Then predictions should return baseline quality
    When processing duplicate observations
    Then model should handle gracefully without instability
    When processing contradictory observations
    Then model should increase uncertainty appropriately
    When kernel matrix becomes ill-conditioned
    Then numerical stability should be maintained

  @performance-benchmarks
  Scenario: Meeting performance requirements
    Given production performance constraints
    When running on standard hardware
    Then incremental updates should complete in < 100ms
    And predictions should complete in < 10ms
    And memory usage should stay under 100MB
    And model should handle 10000+ observations
