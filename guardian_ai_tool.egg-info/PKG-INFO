# Guardian: Code Quality & Security Analysis Tool

Guardian is an intelligent, automated tool designed to empower developers and AI agents to achieve and maintain superior code quality, security, and design. It actively executes tests, provides a holistic Test Effectiveness Score (TES), and performs comprehensive codebase analysis.

## Vision

To create a tool that helps produce high-quality, secure, and well-designed software by providing actionable insights and metrics.

## Core Principles

1.  **TES-Driven:** The Test Effectiveness Score is the central metric.
2.  **Evidence-Based:** Utilizes empirically validated metrics and security standards.
3.  **Active Analysis:** Directly executes tests and gathers metrics.
4.  **Comprehensive Insight:** Covers code quality, test effectiveness, security, and design.
5.  **AI & Developer Centric:** Easy to use for both humans (CLI, future IDE/WebUI) and AI agents (CLI with structured output).
6.  **Actionable Feedback:** Provides clear, prioritized recommendations.

## Current Status

This project is in the initial development phase (Stream 1: Core Platform & Foundational TES Mechanics).
